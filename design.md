### Typography
**Primary Font:** 'Inter' - Clean, technical, highly readable sans-serif
**Secondary Font:** 'JetBrains Mono' - Monospace for code snippets and technical data
**Display Font:** 'Orbitron' - Futuristic, technical feel for headings

**Hierarchy:**
- H1: 3rem, bold, Orbitron
- H2: 2.25rem, semibold, Inter
- H3: 1.875rem, medium, Inter
- Body: 1rem, regular, Inter
- Code: 0.875rem, JetBrains Mono

### Visual Language
**Technical Precision:** Clean lines, geometric shapes, grid-based layouts
**Professional Authority:** Minimalist design with purposeful whitespace
**Network Aesthetic:** Connection lines, node-based layouts, data flow visualization
**Modern Engineering:** Sleek interfaces with subtle tech-inspired details

## Visual Effects

### Used Libraries
- **Anime.js**: Smooth animations for UI transitions and data visualizations
- **ECharts.js**: Interactive skill charts and project statistics
- **p5.js**: Network topology background animations and particle systems
- **Splitting.js**: Text animation effects for headings
- **Splide.js**: Project image carousels and galleries
- **Pixi.js**: Advanced visual effects for hero backgrounds

### Background Effects
**Primary:** Animated network topology with connected nodes using p5.js
- Dark background with subtle glowing connection lines
- Animated data packets moving along connections
- Responsive particle system that reacts to mouse movement
- Color-coded nodes representing different network components

### Animation Effects
**Text Animations:**
- Typewriter effect for main headings using Typed.js
- Character-by-character reveal with stagger timing
- Color cycling emphasis on key technical terms
- Glitch effect for loading states

**UI Animations:**
- Smooth card hover effects with 3D tilt
- Progress bar animations for skill levels
- Fade-in animations for content sections
- Elastic transitions for modal dialogs

### Interactive Elements
**Project Cards:**
- Hover effects with subtle lift and shadow expansion
- Image zoom on hover with overlay information
- Smooth color transitions for technology badges
- Click feedback with ripple effects

**Skill Visualization:**
- Animated progress bars with easing curves
- Interactive skill nodes that expand on hover
- Color-coded categories with smooth transitions
- Real-time updates with smooth value changes

### Header Effect
**Network Visualization Hero:**
- Large-scale animated network diagram background
- Glowing nodes with pulsing connections
- Parallax scrolling effect for depth
- Interactive elements that respond to cursor position
- Subtle particle effects for visual interest

### Styling Approach
**Cards and Containers:**
- Subtle gradients with low saturation
- Soft shadows for depth without harshness
- Rounded corners for modern feel
- Glass morphism effects for overlays

**Data Visualization:**
- Consistent color scheme across all charts
- Smooth animations for data updates
- Interactive tooltips with technical details
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Navigation:**
- Fixed header with blur background effect
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Active state indicators with glowing effects
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

This design creates a sophisticated, technically-professional aesthetic that immediately communicates expertise in network engineering while maintaining excellent usability and visual appeal.
